            Lee climbed out of the spaceship, Bernard tightly clutching his back like some sort of furry backpack. A
            magenta fog drifted around the rooftop they had landed on, continuing for miles. It was hot and humid, and
            Lee could feel sweat beading up around his gas mask. As the spaceship shimmered away into stealth mode, Lee
            stared out into the sea of smog, penetrated by skyscrapers every few feet. </p>
        <p>“I guess this is Pacisci,” he said.</p>
        <p>“Yep.” Bernard replied.</p>
        <p>“It doesn’t look as nice as Kai’s letter described,” Lee said.</p>
        <p>“Eh,” the koala said. “You wanted more info on Kai. Doesn’t matter if it looks nice, does it?”</p>
        <p>“I guess.” Lee said.</p>
        <p>“Come on kid, get your head out of the clouds.” Bernard said, smacking the back of Lee’s head.</p>
        <p>Lee shook his head. “Yeah, sorry. <span class="lexia-link" onclick="clickLexia('lexia-a')">Let’s go</span>.”
        </p>

        <p>
            As the pair entered the building, a swath of cold air blew over them. Exiting the stairwell, they found
            themselves in a long hallway decorated by a plush red carpet. A gentle light shone from above, illuminating
            walls filled from head to toe with framed papers. </p>
        <p>“Weird place,” Bernard muttered. “Looks like an office or something.”</p>
        <p>“Yeah, it does.” Lee whispered. “We should probably go.”</p>
        <p>“There’s an elevator on the left,” Bernard said. “We could take that.”</p>
        <p>“What if someone else gets in the elevator?” Lee replied. “I think we’re safer taking the stairs.”</p>
        <p>“We’re on the top floor,” Bernard said. “That’s a lot of walking.”</p>
        <p>“Yeah, but I’m doing the walking. C’mon.” Lee turned and pushed the stairwell door open, just as the elevator
            emitted a soft <em>ding</em> and opened, revealing a slender woman with purple skin. She wore a black
            business suit and was flanked by two burly men, similarly dressed.</p>
        <p>“A child? How did you get in here?” she asked.</p>
        <p>But Lee was already <span class="lexia-link" onclick="clickLexia('lexia-b')">gone</span>, the door shutting
            behind him.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="lexia-b">

        <p>
        <p>“She shouldn’t be leaving her door unlocked if she doesn’t want visitors!” Bernard said.</p>
        <p>“That’s not exactly important right now!” Lee said. They were about three stairwells down already, and his
            mask was feeling sticky and thick against his skin. He paused to take a breath, tearing his mask off, only
            to be spurred on by the sound of footsteps approaching a few stairwells above.</p>
        <p>“How many floors does this building have?” Lee asked.</p>
        <p>“You think I checked the number at the top? I thought we’d be peacefully taking the elevator down!”</p>
        <p>Running through another landing, Lee glanced to his right for a floor number. Floor 11. </p>
        <p>“I don’t know if I’m going to make it,” Lee said.</p>
        <p>“You can do it, kid. I believe in you.” Bernard said. “But you may wanna pick up the pace. I think they’re
            gaining on us.” </p>
        <p>Lee looked back in alarm, only to look back and see another woman in a suit in front of him. He let out a
            shocked gasp before he was grabbed roughly by the shoulder.</p>
        <p>“We got him.” she said, putting her hand up to a radio by her ear. “Yeah. Yup. I’ll bring him up.” Dropping
            her hand, she turned to Lee. <span class="lexia-link" onclick="clickLexia('lexia-c')">“C'mon kid.”</span>
        </p>

    </div>
    <div id="lexia-c">
        <p>“So,” the woman said. “How did you get into my office?”</p>
        <p>Lee and Bernard stood in front of a fine desk, flanked by two men. Behind the desk sat the slender woman,
            sipping coffee with a cunning smile.</p>
        <p>“W-we came through the stairwell,” Lee said. “We didn’t mean to cause trouble. Please don’t hurt us.” He held
            his gas mask in a vice grip.</p>
        <p>The woman sighed. </p>
        <p>“I suppose that it’s my fault for not locking the door. I could have sworn it was supposed to do that
            automatically.” Her eyes clouded over momentarily, drifting into a corner before snapping back to Lee and
            Bernard. “A more important question, I believe, is why you’re here. Are you payment for a loan? I do believe
            that one of my associates said they were going to send a child over.” She pulled out a large book labeled
            “Ledger” and began to turn through its pages.</p>
        <p>Lee gulped. </p>
        <p>“N-no, we’re here to find my brother. His name was Kai.”</p>
        <p>The woman’s eyes narrowed, and a sly grin spread across her face.</p>
        <p>“You mean to tell me,” she said. “That you are the brother of Kai, the Liberator? Freer of my people?”</p>
        <p>Lee nodded, his eyes lighting up.</p>
        <p>“Yes, that’s me-”</p>
        <p>“You can’t possibly think that I would believe that, do you?” The woman said with a small laugh. “I am
            supposed to have a child delivered, and the one that turns up <em>conveniently</em> happens to be the
            brother of Kai?”</p>
        <p>Lee nodded, the gas mask shaking in his grasp.</p>
        <p>“I can vouch for the kid,” Bernard said. “Unless you have talking koalas on your planet, in which case it
            probably doesn’t help much.”</p>
        <p>There was frantic clattering as both guards drew guns and aimed them at Bernard’s head, before bashfully
            lowering their firearms.</p>
        <p>“This certainly does change things slightly,” the woman said, raising an eyebrow. “We do not have speaking
            animals on this planet.”</p>
        <p>“Well, now you’ve met one,” Bernard said. “What can you tell us about Kai?”</p>
        <p>“So rude,” the woman said. “Despite your ability to speak, you certainly still act like an animal.”</p>
        <p>“I’m sorry, that’s just the way he is.” Lee said. “Could you please tell me more about my brother?”</p>
        <p>“That’s more like it,” the woman said. “Now then-”</p>
        <p>Another <em>ding</em> sounded from the elevator, and the doors at the end of the hallway opened, revealing a short old man with purple skin and a two piece suit, holding a briefcase. Behind him stood two menacing bodyguards.</p>
        <p>“Good morning, Leonora.” he said, approaching from the hall. “I’ve come to discuss our recent business
            agreement.”</p>
        <p>“Good morning, Arturo. I’m afraid I’m busy at the moment, so you will have to wait. Perhaps you can use the
            time to fetch the child you owe me, as I see you don’t have it with you.”</p>
        <p>“Busy? With whom? This child?” Arturo asked, peering over at Lee. Suddenly, he gasped. “Lee? Is your name
            Lee?”</p>
        <p>Lee stared at Arturo for a moment before responding.</p>
        <p>“Yeah, that’s my name. How did you know?”</p>
        <p>Arturo clapped Lee on the shoulder and gave him a wide grin.</p>
        <p>“I was one of the people at the forefront of the revolution with your brother. He never stopped talking about
            you, always waving around a picture. You look just like the photos.”</p>
        <p>“Arturo.” Leonora said. “I ask that you be quiet. You are interfering with potential negotiations.”</p>
        <p>“Yeah, you were going to tell me about my brother, right?” Lee asked.</p>
        <p>“Perhaps, for a price.” Leonora said, opening a drawer and sliding forward a piece of paper from it. “To
            receive, you must give, after all.”</p>
        <p>“Leonora!” Arturo said. “Are you attempting to force this child to sign a contract for something so little as
            information about his brother? I am appalled.”</p>
        <p>“You forget that Kai owed me quite a bit of money, then ran away when I approached him about it. The debt
            falls onto his brother.” Leonora said, setting her coffee down and standing up.</p>
        <p>“Lee,” Arturo said, patting him on the shoulder. “I will tell you as much as you’d like about your brother if
            you allow Leonora and I to talk business for a moment.”</p>

        </h1>
        <p>“Oh,” Lee said. “Okay.”</p>
        <p>He turned and walked out into the stairwell, closing the door behind him. </p>
        <p>“Kid, are you sure we can trust this guy?” Bernard asked. “This is sort of fishy.” </p>
        <p>“I think it’s okay,” Lee said. “He said he knew Kai.”</p>
        <p>“You can know someone and that doesn’t mean you can trust them, kid.” Bernard said, slapping Lee’s
            shoulder.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, there was the gunfire rang out from the room.</p>
        <p>“Shit, let’s book it!” Bernard yelled. “To the ship!”</p>
        <p>Lee nodded and dashed out the doors to where the ship was. Bernard climbed up onto Lee’s shoulder and hit a
            panel on the side, uncloaking it and opening the door with a soft <em>click</em>. They tumbled in and closed
            the panel, coughing. There was a moment of silence, as they stared out the ship window, waiting. After a few
            minutes, a figure approached from the fog, arms raised above their head. </p>
        <p>Lee opened the door to the ship, smoking drifting in as Arturo walked up to the ship.</p>
        <p>“I apologize for the scare,” he said. “However I simply couldn’t allow her to do as she pleased anymore. May
            I come in?”</p>
        <p>“Of course,” Lee said.</p>
        <p>“I’ve got my eye on you, bub.” Bernard said.</p>
        <p>Arturo climbed into the ship, looking around.</p>
        <p>“It looks just like it did when Kai had it,” he said.</p>
        <p>“You really knew my brother?” Lee asked.</p>
        <p>“Of course,” Arturo said. “He was a good man, albeit a bit foolish.”</p>
        <p>“Can you tell me about him? Is he here?”</p>
        <p>Arturo scratched his chin. “Well, I don’t think he’s here, child. If he is, he hasn’t talked to anyone in a
            long, long time.”</p>
        <p>“Oh…” Lee said. </p>
        <p>“But while he was here he made good changes. From the moment he came to this place he was trying to help us
            “lower caste” folks gain equality. Didn’t take long for him to lead a full on revolution.”</p>
        <p>“I always thought Kai was a peace-loving guy,” Bernard said. “I’m surprised he encouraged violence.”</p>
        <p>“Oh he didn’t.” Arturo responded. “But we insisted that those above us wouldn’t listen to peaceful
            negotiations. He didn’t like it, but he helped out everywhere but the actual battlefield. He was real proud
            when the revolution was successful. Got a big head for a bit. People didn’t like that much, but he had
            helped so much that we ignored it. He was a solid guy overall.” </p>
        <p>“Wait, what happened then?” Lee asked. “It looks like the exact same stuff is going on. You guys were talking
            about slaves, right?”</p>
        <p>“Ah… Yes.” Arturo said. “At first we started by just taking up higher ranking positions, starting our own
            business ventures, etc.”</p>
        <p>Arturo let out a long sigh.</p>
        <p>“But towards the tail end of his stay here, before he ran from Leonora’s money-hunting ways, people started
            to get a bit angry. The people of the ex-upper caste were still being assholes-pardon my language- and
            people weren’t ready to tolerate that.”</p>
        <p>“So they pushed them down the rankings?” Bernard asked.</p>
        <p>“Precisely.” Arturo said. “They began to replace the ‘equality’ with ‘oppression’ once more. Shortly
            afterwards, your brother left us, and it’s been like that every since.” </p>
        <p>“Oh…” Lee said quietly. His hands fell to his side.</p>
        <p>“Don’t get me wrong, Lee.” Arturo said softly. “Your brother had good intentions, but our society isn’t
            something that’s so easy to change. But I won’t take it any longer. I’m going to start trying to move
            towards true equality. It’s what your brother would have wanted.”</p>
        <p>“Okay…” Lee said.</p>
        <p>“You’re acting like you know what happened to Kai.” Bernard said. “Is there anything you’re not telling us?”
            He narrowed his eyes at Arturo. </p>
        <p>Arturo shook his head. “No, unfortunately. I wish I could tell you where he was, but I can’t. Honestly, I
            think your best and safest bet is to move on from this place. If Kai hasn’t come home, I’m sure he’s out
            there somewhere.” Arturo patted Lee’s shoulder and smiled. “I’ll let you get going. You go out there and find your brother, and I’ll keep fighting the good fight here, alright?”</p>
        <p>Lee nodded. “Alright.” </p>
        <p>“Atta boy.”</p>
        <p>Arturo pushed open the hatch and climbed out of the ship.</p>
        <p>“Take care of the kid, talking animal.” </p>
        <p>“Will do, old guy.”</p>
        <p>Arturo gave Lee one more quick smile before disappearing into the fog. The hatch slowly closed, and Bernard
            began to prepare for the ship to head to their next destination.</p>

        <p>
            “Hey,” Bernard said. “We were here first.”</p>
        <p>“I understand that,” Arturo replied. “But if you don’t mind simply giving me a moment-” </p>
        <p>“Can I stay and listen?” Lee said. “It can’t hurt, right?”</p>
        <p>“Yes, it could do good for the boy to learn some things about business.” Leonora said, walking out from
            behind her desk. “So, what did you come to talk to me about, Arturo? Does it relate to the lack of child? Do
            you need an extension?” </p>
        <p>“No,” Arturo said. “I’m not paying with a child anymore. We’ve perpetrated slavery for too long, now.” He
            lifted up his briefcase and opened it to reveal mounds of paper currency. “This is the equivalent of what I
            owe.” </p>
        <p>“The agreement was that you would be giving me a child to be used as I wish,” Leonora said. “What is the
            meaning of giving me this instead?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t care if the children are of the previous ruling class,” Arturo said. “We are only perpetuating hate
            by continuing to use them as property. In time, they will do to us what we did to them.” </p>
        <p>“I see,” Leonora said. “Let me give you new incentive, then.” She nodded to one of her guards, who pulled out
            a gun and aimed it at Lee. Lee froze, his eyes widening.
            “If you refuse to hold up your end of the deal, then innocent blood will be on your hands.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t understand!” Arturo yelled. “Why won’t you just accept the money? This is enough to buy more than
            one slave, if you require one so much.” </p>
        <p>“Because,” Leonora said, nodding at her guard once more. “It’s important you understand that agreements are
            not made to be broken so lightly.”</p>
        <p>“NO!” Bernard yelled.</p>
        <p>Arturo attempted to leap in front of the guard, but it was too late.</p>
        <p>A gunshot rang through the room.</p>
        <p>“Let this be a lesson.”</p>
