            Depressus
        </h1>

        <p>For this planet, the souvenir was a coat, made of something thick like leather and lined with fur. At the end
            of the sleeves, gloves had been sewn into the design, made of the same material if not thinner. Lee put it
            on over his regular gear, pulling up the hood and lacing up the front. It was baggy and hung down to his
            ankles. He opened the hatch and exited the ship. </p>
        <p>He was greeted by bright blue light and frigid air that made Lee bury his chin into the coat’s collar. A flat
            expanse of ice and water stretched in every direction. The spaceship was on a block of ice just large enough
            to fit the ship and a few yards of walking distance. The spaceship was situated to the far side of the
            island, near the edge, and its precarious position was what had made the island leaned up on one side. </p>
        <p>Besides Bernard’s grumbling from inside the spaceship, there was the sound of rushing water. A white wake of
            water trailed behind the island, showing it was moving a steady pace. </p>
        <p>In the water, dark shapes moved, and Lee knelt at the edge, looking down at the closest dark wriggling shape.
            A wet head and pair of glossy eyes broke the surface and regarded the viewer. </p>

        <p>The skin was slick, miniscule scales trapping droplets of water and reflecting the dull rays of the two suns
            that perpetually hung around the horizon. Narrow nostrils at the end of a long snout pushed up out of the
            water, sniffing at the stranger. But it wasn’t long before the creature trailed away and the head
            disappeared under the surface. </p>
        <p>There was a steady breeze, the type that sucked out the heat if it was not bundled all in. In the distance,
            other blocks of ice wandered around, but Lee could also see silhouettes of varying sizes on the other
            islands which, when he squinted, were houses and figures wandering around. </p>

        <p>Lee pulled out his brother’s letter from his pocket, scanning it over. </p>
        </br>
        </br>
        <p>Brother, </p>
        <p>What amazing news to I have for you this time! I have found life on a planet hardly bigger than a stray moon.
            The days are so short and 98% of the planet is made of water! Isn’t that mind blowing? The other 2% are the
            rare mountain tops that stick out of the current. But I get ahead of myself, what a strange planet, it has
            two ‘land masses’ that serve as sort of ‘north and south’ poles I suppose… The unique part of this planet is
            that all the water is stuck in currents, eternally looping around its miniscule circumference. The people
            suit it, they are a simple folk who have not even discovered fire yet! Quite strange, but not to worry, I am
            doing my best and working hard to help educate them and make their lives easier. </p>
        <p>This is the last message pod I have to send out. Next time you hear from me, it will be on my return
        home. </p>
        <p>
        - Kai
        </p>
        </br></br>
        <p>It wasn’t long before the other islands floated closer. Lee saw the skins of the creatures from the water
        stretched out in the sun to dry. </p>

        <p>None of the islands could fit more than an ice hut or two and some walking space. The people were wrapped in
        layers of coats made from hides of the water creatures as well as wool from the sheep-like lizards that were
        kept in a few pens behind the homes of the people. </p>

        <p>The people themselves were as pale as the ice around them, their skin translucent so their veins could be
            seen under their skin. Their eyes were all shades of violet, speckles of red and grey seen in their pupils.
            Their long white beads were adorned with beads and ornaments strung into them. They were wrapped around
            their necks as scarves, braided and brushed out. </p>
        <p>Eventually one of the islands floated only feet away from Lee’s island and he rushed forwards waving his
        hand. The occupant was a thick browed man, and he wrinkled his nose at the boy. </p>
        <p> “What da’ yew wan’?” He asked in deep growl. </p>

            Lee dropped his arms.
        </h1>
        <p>The man glared until their islands drifted apart from each other. </p>

        <p>Lee’s island drifted for hours, sometimes the curvature of the small planet hiding all the other islands
        from view. The two suns kept it from never being the true night that Lee remembered. </p>
        <p> “It’s cold as death out there! Get back in here before you freeze off a leg or something.” Bernard was at
            the opening hatch of the spaceship. </p>
        <p> “This coat keeps me warm,” Lee shrugged. Bernard waited near the door, a blanket wrapped around his tiny
            form. </p>

        <p> “Listen, kid,” the small creature pulled out his flask, taking a swing, “I know what you saw on the last
            planet wasn’t pleasant, it fuckin’ scared me a lot too, and it takes a lot to scare things like me. But the
            truth is the truth, in my book your brother was a great bloke, saved my life and all that, taught me how to
            talk, fly and read. He isn’t all bad no matter how those guys made him sound.” </p>
        <p>Lee shook his head. </p>
        <p> “I don’t know. I wish you had never come.” His voice cracked and he wiped at his nose with the coat
            sleeve. </p>
        <p> “There’s a saying where I come from, that ignorance is bliss.” Bernard speculated, taking another swig from
            his flask, “but I don’t believe it, ignorance looks nice and feels nice, but it leads to more shit. What
            happens if I didn’t come and you never got another letter eh? You would figure out he was dead or find a way
            to go searching for him and we would be here all over again except without me…and I like you kid, you’re a
            handful, but you’re good.” </p>

        <p>Lee didn’t answer and gazed out at the old expanse around them. Bernard didn’t wait long. </p>
        <p> “Don’t catch any colds out here.” He murmured and <span class="lexia-link"
                                                                    onclick="clickLexia('lexia-end')"> closed the hatch. </span>

        <p>Lee entered the ship again and warmth washed over him. By the time he removed the coat and his gear he was
            sweating. </p>
        <p> “Finally, home?” Bernard called, “if that’s you.” </p>
        <p> “It’s me,” Lee answered and went to the piloting seat where Bernard was curled up with a mug of a dark hot
            liquid. </p>
        <p> “Anyone nice here?” Bernard ask and Lee shook is head. “You’d think there would be at least one nice fuck in
            the universe, you know.” </p>
        <p> “I guess,” Lee answered, “People just don’t like strangers.” </p>
        <p> “Yeah, I guess tourists aren’t popular anywhere.” Bernard looked up into Lee’s face. </p>
        <p> “You doin’ alright?” </p>
        <p> “I don’t know.” </p>
        <p>Bernard grimaced. </p>
        <p> “Ready to go then, Lee?” </p>
        <p>The boy nodded and removed his gear. </p>

            Lee waited for the next island to pass him.
        </h1>
        <p>At the next island, Lee plucked up his courage and waved again. This time, a figure of a woman waved back
        and she disappeared into her ice hut. She exited with her arms full of a rope with a nasty looking hook at the
        end of it. Lee stepped back, and the woman began to swing the hook around her head like a lasso. She threw it at
        Lee’s island and the hook dug deep into the ice sheet. She swiftly tied the other end of the rope to a bone
        stake imbedded in her island. the islands continued to drift, the rope grew taut but did not break and both
        islands began floating together. The girl beckoned to Lee, but he shook his head. The gap between the two
        islands was still several yards. She hopped onto the rope and tightroped across to him. </p>
        <p> “Who are you?” She asked. She was taller than him and placed her hands on her hips. Lee told her his name
        “I’m Ase, what are you doing here?” She asked, glancing back at the spaceship. “Ye’ got that idiot from before
        with you? The one that liked fire?” </p>

        <p> “You’ve met Kai then,” Lee said dully, putting his hands in his coat pockets and feeling the crumpled letter
            there. </p>
        <p> “Yeah, we all have. He thought it was a good idea to make a spark, blew up half an island, he did. Nothin’
            round here is safe to set on fire, good for us we kept the fire from getting not the water and roasting our
            fishies up.” </p>
        <p> “How do you stay warm then?” Lee asked. Ase raised her arms to both sides. </p>
        <p> “By stayin’ bundled up silly. What do they walk around naked where you are from?” </p>
        <p> “Not exact-” </p>
        <p> “Then what’s so hard to understand about that.” </p>
        <p>Ase hopped past Lee and approached spaceship. </p>
        <p> “It ain’t very stable on here is it?” she observed and put a hand out, laying it against the metal. “Do you
            live in here?” </p>
        <p> “Sort of,” Lee answered, walking over. </p>
        <p> “I wonder, if…” she put both hands out and gave the ship one shove. The entire ship tipped and rocked before
            falling backwards in a slow-motion arch and splashing down, down into the water. Lee screamed and ran, wild
            thoughts about Bernard still inside, but Ase grabbed his arm as he dove towards the edge. </p>
        <p> “My friend is in there!” Lee exclaimed and wriggled, trying to get away, but Ase was strong and held on with
            little effort. The ship sunk beneath the surface and out of sight forever. </p>
        <p> “Welcome to our planet,” Ase smiled, but Lee did not smile back. </p>
