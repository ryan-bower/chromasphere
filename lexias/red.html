            Red Fiercely Planet
        </h1>
        <p>
            The planet looks like it could be a heat wave. Lee can see the planet being covered with thick and humid air
            making it uncomfortable to be outside.
        </p>
        <p>
            The spaceship was already en route to Red Fiercely Planet. It had a large area of desert covering the most
            of the planet. The half of planet (South Pole to Equator) was on a blazing fire. The remaining parts were
            made up of Rocky Mountains.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bernard said, “Most of planet’s atmosphere is too hot. We will have to enter the spot that is the coolest
            out of all atmosphere."
        </p>
        <p>
            Lee looked at the map, “But we will land on the desert.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Bernard answered, “No choices, better than die in burning or exploding.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Lee and Bernard got off the rocket and he asked Bernard, “Where are we anyway?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Bernard answered, “You asked a wrong koala, boy, but we won’t gain anyway if we waited. We need to find a
            village.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Both of them could only see nothing, but miles and miles of desert surrounding them. They picked up what is
            left of water and foods before they were travelling through the desert.
        </p>
        <p>
            For hours, they still couldn’t find anything in the middle of the desert. Lee was getting worried because
            their water was running out, as they lacked access to safe drinking water when you're traveling. He noticed
            that Bernard was becoming dehydrated; he wouldn’t stop grumbling some nonsense. Lee looked around once again
            and finally found a huge pile of rocks. He dragged Bernard, walking as fast as he can.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was quite a trip before they finally arrived at the rocks. Bernard sighed, “Ahh, I am so glad that there
            is a shade. I feel like I am about to have a heatstroke. Stupid shitty fur. Making me sweating. Boy, I smell
            like Hippo piss.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Quiet! Did you hear that?” whispered Lee. The ground was little shaking. “What was that?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Both of them climbed over the rocks and found a large scale battle between two tribes across the valley.
            They were just watching in awe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bernard whispered, “I think we better gotta our hairy asses of here.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Lee nodded in agreement. However, before they came to realize, a group of men on the horses were already on
            their way to the rocks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bernard shouted, “RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!”
        </p>
        <p>
            Lee grabbed Bernard, put him on his back and ran as fast as he could. Bernard looked back and could see the
            horses were getting closer and closer. He shouted, “We won’t make it!!”
        </p>
        <p>
            Lee looked back in panic and suddenly, he slipped on the edge of a steep hill. He fell and rolled all way
            down. Bernard was flying into the air like bird as if it was shot. When he finally stopped rolling at the
            bottom of the hill, he immediately checked on the men who were chasing after them. They just stopped on the
            top of the hill and turned around back. Lee sighed in relief. However, the battle was practically a few feet
            away from the rocks where the boy was hiding. “I don’t know where we can go from this” thought Lee. He got
            startled when Bernard’s legs popped out of the sand. He ran and pulled him out of the sand. Bernard shaked
            his head to get the sand out of his big ears and saw the boy, but the shadow person was standing behind him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lee is still unmoving as if his head is frozen.

        <p>
            He turned around and saw the dark red skin man who looked furious. He knelt down and gave the boy a hand.
            Lee realized the red man was trying to help him. Lee grabbed his hand…
        </p>
        <p>
            Rather than destruction and bloody, it was a paradise everywhere. Those red tribes love war more than
            anything. They lived for it. It was a honor to die in combat. Their families won’t be sad if one of their
            members died in battle. Again, it was really a paradise because their economies were booming and everyone
            were practically living a luxury life. Lee was fairly good in history classes. He was well-aware that war
            was an awful thing and many unnecessary lives were lost. Yet, this culture was completely different and he
            still can’t believe it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, Lee found it quite odd because the war was their daily activity and many lives were lost
            unfortunately, so, the population should be declining. Yet, the number of the population had been still the
            same for hundreds years. The number didn’t increase or decrease. It was just stable. The boy couldn’t stop
            being astround. If it were like that on Earth, it would be in disaster.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Why do you have a war with other tribes?” asked Lee.
        </p>
        <p>
            The chief of a tribe said and still for a moment, “Those lowlife destroyed our planet. As you can see, half
            of our planet is covered by fire burning.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “How is that possible?” said Lee.
        </p>
        <p>
            The chief sighed and replied, “ We didn’t exactly know. Our ancestors never really share any kind of history
            or heritage with us. Nobody really knows. This war has been lasting for really a long time. It is raging for
            more than hundreds years. Perhaps more than that. All we know is those tribes are the causing of this
            damages.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Lee was quieted for a while. He still didn’t understand their culture at all. He still believed the war is
            wrong. He couldn’t bear the thought of losing a family member to war.
        </p>
        <p>
            Chief broke the silence, “You seem unhappy?”
        </p>
        <p>
            He replied, “No, that is not it. I just don’t understand why. What is the point? It is all in the past. Why
            do you still have war? Though you said that, but you still celebrate for every warrior who died in the war.
            Don’t you find that sad?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Chief was silent for a minute and looked into the eyes of the sad boy. He finally spoke, “War is what makes
            us flourish. War is what keeps us alive for generations and generations. War is what makes us living a
            luxury life. War is what gives us a identify and culture. War is what keeps us, tribes, stay together
            strongly…… War is everything. It doesn't matter if we are angry at them for destroying our planet anymore.
            We became one with war. So… no we didn’t find that sad because it is the most honor thing that any warrior
            could receive. Boy, you are young. One day, you will understand why. You will learn to accept our culture.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Lee went silent and didn’t know how to respond back.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Well, it is getting late. We better get ready for bed. Boy, Horath will guide you to a room. Good night.”
            said the Chief.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later that night, Lee was laying down on the bed. Out of blue, Bernard popped out of the window and boomed,
            “GUESS WHAT I FOUND FROM LIBRARY!”
        </p>
        <p>
            The boy was shocked and said, “Will you stop doing that! I nearly got heart attack!”
        </p>
        <p>
            Bernard chuckled, “Oh please, stop being wuss. You will be fine. Anyway, more important, look at this!” He
            handled the letter to Lee. “It is from your brother! Hurry up and read it!”
        </p>
        <p>
            Lee wasted no time and opened the letter and read it.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I don’t understand this planet and those people at all. I tried to encourage them to stop the war and
            seeking the peace. Not a single being in here would agree with me. I travelled to other places where other
            tribes lived. All of them said the same thing. “We became one with war.” Even, they said it was other
            tribes’ fault to they destroyed the planet. I don’t think that is the case anymore. War is like a addiction
            that they couldn’t quit. It is awful thing that any living being could have. Yet, it is like a paradise to
            them. I don’t get it anymore. I don’t know what to do. They banned me from all of their villages. There is
            nothing left for me to stay anymore.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Lee went silent… Bernard whispered, “Well, what did it say? Why do you look so down?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Lee broke the silence and showed the letter to Bernard, “I don’t understand… My brother just wanted to help
            them.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Bernard sighed, “Boy, guess there is nothing we can do in here like he said. So, what do you want to do
            next?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Lee looked back in silence. He spoke, "Let's go to next planet."
        </p>

        <p>
            He ran away as fast as he could with Bernard. He didn’t bother to look back. He just ran and ran until his
            breath ran out. When he stopped and looked around back, he realized he lost his way again. There is one way
            back, but it was full of a bloodbath. Suddenly, he saw the other group of men with maroon skin on the horses
            in their direction.
        </p>
        <p>
            The boy tried to run away. The horsemen caught up and threw their spear at him.
            The end...
