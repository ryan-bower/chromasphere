        <p>Lee looked out at an endless expanse of yellow from the spaceship. His heart was thumping in his chest and he
            turned to Bernard who shifted and fidgeted. </p>
        <p> “Is …is this it?” Lee asked staring at the pilot, “the planet that Kai…” </p>
        <p> “I think so, I followed his coordinates and they were all together right.” </p>
        <p>Kai nodded. </p>
        <p> “I’m going out.” </p>
        <p> “Not without me you ain’t,” Bernard exclaimed and Lee let him crawl up onto his back. </p>
        <p>Outside the yellow grass came up to Lee’s chest and he waded through it, disturbing small bugs with two
            heads, some translucent, others with the same gold tinge as the grass they landed upon. </p>
        <p> “Where are we headed? Bernard asked and Lee shrugged. </p>
        <p> “Everywhere is new, so I dunno, until we find something?” </p>
        <p> “If you are looking for grass, we got tons of that fucking stuff. Enough to cause someone to sneeze.” </p>
        <p>Lee laughed but did not answer. The two of them had been wading along for a while, so they could only see the
            top of the ship in the distance when Lee nearly tripped over a girl. She yelped and jumped to her feet. </p>
        <p> “Hey! Watch it!” She exclaimed before looking Lee up and down. “Wait, who are you?” She had fiery red hair
            and a dress made of a pale canvas scratchy material. A blush of freckles started at her forehead and spread
            over her cheek under bright brown eyes. </p>
        <p> “I’m sorry,” Lee stammered and Bernard curled up against Lee’s back, muttering something or another, “I’m
            not from around here. I came from outer space.” </p>
        <p> “What, you sayin’ people live up there in the stars?” She accused and Lee nodded. “So you ain’t part of any
            village.” Lee shook his head. “Well, you better come with me stranger, get something to eat, you look half
            starved.” </p>
        <p> “I’ve been traveling a lot.” </p>
        <p> “You’re just a kid though.” </p>
        <p> “He’s got me!” Bernard crawled up so he had his head atop of Lee’s and used the boy’s ears as hand holds.
            The girl stared, her mouth agape. “Watch it, a fly might go into it,” Bernard growled and the girl shook
            herself. </p>
        <p> “Well, anyways, whatever that…thing is, it ain’t no adult, let’s go to the village and we’ll decide what to
            do there.” She picked up a woven basket, full of mushrooms and some sort of swollen roots, placed it at her
            hip. </p>
        <p>Lee followed the girl. After the fields of grass had ended, they crossed a stream the color of amber, fish
            swam down below and they arrived at a village whose huts were made out of the yellow grass all bundled
            up. </p>
        <p> “Grandmother!” The girl called, “we have a visitor!” </p>
        <p>A wizened old woman, leaning on a cane hobbled out of one of the nearer huts. She had a hat made up of black
            feathers and a dull grey blanket wrapped around her shoulders. When she got close, she smelled of incense
            and sandalwood. </p>
        <p> “Welcome, strangers,” she smiled, when she spoke Lee saw no teeth in her mouth, “are you hungry?” </p>
        <p>

            <span class="lexia-link lexia-back" onclick="clickLexia('lexia-a')"> “Yes!” </span></p>

            “Yes!”
        </h1>

        <p> “Do you have leaves or something to gnaw on?” Bernard piped up, moving his position to hang off Lee’s
            arm. </p>
        <p> “We have loaves of seed bread, if that suits you,” She said and turned around, “come inside and we’ll
            talk.” </p>
        <p>The hut was sparsely decorated besides a low table to sit around and a carpet made of woven grass.. The old
            woman spoke and explain while Lee and Bernard sat back and sipped a type of herbal tea smelling of
            lavender. </p>
        <p>The girl, whose name was Loti was one of the younger girls of the village, and this old woman, Lola was the
            wise woman of the village. Lee learned of a war long past, that had left the land flattened of all life. The
            trees had all been used within the war or blown up and in the aftermath of the conflict, most of the
            population had died. They had been rebuilding their culture and identity since Lola had been a small child
            and all advanced technology had been banned. The survivors, who wished to keep the technology had been
            exiled and they took the last of their spaceships up, up and away past the atmosphere to the skies
            above. </p>

        </h1>
        <p> “We are one family down here,” Lola explained, “all brothers and sisters, every adult is a parent of
        all the children of the village, and each different village is our cousins.” </p>
        <p> “So who’s the big daddy?” Bernard asked, scarfing down his tea and dipping the seeded bread they had
            been presented with. Lee moved his portion over to Bernard who gladly at it with gusto. “The big mom,
            the government, whatever you want to call it.” </p>
        <p> “Government? Loti asked, rolling the foreign word around her tongue. Lola smiled with her toothless gums
            and laughed gently. </p>
        <p> “There has not been such a thing since the great war,” she explained, “we dispelled our government way
            back when, everyone works the same tasks if they are able, and we decide together what to do next.” </p>
        <p> “How does that work out for yah,” Bernard asked through a mouthful of bread. </p>
        <p> “Why wouldn’t it work?” Loti asked, narrowing her eyes at the small furry pilot. </p>
        <p>Lola ignored the girl and pilot glaring at each other and turned to Lee. </p>
        <p> “What is your story though?” She asked, “why are you here.” Lee gave his best explanation about his
            brother’s goals, journey and dreams of helping bring peace to their hope planet and others and Lola
            smiled. </p>
        <p> “And how have the other planets liked his interference with their affairs?” Lee dropped his eyes from
            her wrinkled smile and looked at his empty ceramic cup. “Boy, how about you stay here and see what we
            are about?” She asked, “and you can leave when you want.” </p>
        <p> “That sounds…good,” Lee said, looking down at Bernard. </p>
        <p> “Why are you starin’ at me? It’s your decision kid, I could leave you here if you wanted even.” </p>
        <p> “So you won’t stay with me?” Lee asked, his temporary good humor fading quickly. </p>
        <p> “You do what ya like, I’m stickin’ near ya, can’t let Kai’s squirt of a brother live in this world all
            by himself.” </p>
        <p>Lee smiled and scooped up the pilot, hugging him like a stuffed animal. </p>
        <p> “Come one boy, lemme fuckin’ go!” He exclaimed but didn’t struggle and the two women laughed. </p>

            Lee shook his head.
        </h1>
        <p> “We are alright,” Lee said and put a hand back on Bernard’s head to keep him from protesting. </p>
        <p> “You’re so small though,” the girl said. </p>
        <p> “Loti,” the old woman reprimanded he girl and she frowned. </p>
        <p> “But grandmother, look how thin he is.” </p>
        <p> “Respect, Loti, is the first sign of a welcoming host,” her grandmother said, smiling with a toothless
            mouth. “What is your name boy?” </p>
        <p> “I’m Lee.” </p>
        <p> “I am Lola, the eldest of the grandparents of this village, would you like to walk with us?” </p>
        <p>Lola, Loti and Lee with Bernard on his back walked through the village, observing children playing and
            running around and adults were working together to hang up laundry, or shuck the vegetables into
            baskets. Everyone was talking or had their head down focusing on their work, men and women alike wore
            long robes and dresses of the scratchy yellow canvas that Loti wore. </p>
        <p> “What’s your home like?” Loti asked as they walked. </p>
        <p>Lee shrugged. </p>
        <p> “Quite, we had this big war before I was born. My brother and I used to walk around the streets and look
            for food from the scraps of restaurants or beg. It’s not like that anymore. My brother left and…and I
            came out here looking for him.” </p>
        <p> “And did you find him?” </p>
        <p> “He’s dead.” They continued to walk and Lee burst out with rapid speech, “He never made it here, but he
            was always looking for you guys, he thought you could come help our planet. </p>
        <p> “Oh?” Lola asked. </p>
        <p> “Yes,” Lee answered, “not until his work is done will I rest.” </p>
        <p> “That’s how a man ends up dying,” Lola said, her smile turning sad. “But what did he want?” </p>
        <p> “To help, help everyone, but...but he sometimes did harm while trying to do good. Home is rough at
            times, and he thought he could fix everything. I know now I can’t fix other places, but I still wanna
            help where I am from.” </p>
        <p> “I see,” Lola said and they reached the end of the village. In front of them a stream ran and on the
            other side, the ground dipped and curved in familiar deep chasm. “See those, those chasms were made by
            the war that killed most of our people. My grandparents, my uncles and aunts…” Her eyes were unfocused
            and her smile had faded. Loti moved closer and curled her fingers through her grandmothers, kissing her
            wrinkled cheek. Lola’s eyes focused and she patted Loti’s head. </p>
        <p> “We’ve been replanting all the grass,” Loti said turning to Lee, “and the trees, but most of the trees
            die. This land used to be all baron, at first, all we did was build up around the village, but that
            wasn’t sustainable. It took many years, but we finally have a few trees to the west that are growing
            up.” Loti pointed and Lee saw a small black line of trees in the far distance. “It’s a work in
            progress.” </p>
        <p> “So the land could be saved?” Lee queried. </p>
        <p> “With enough love and care,” Lola said, “and patience, lots of patience. Rejoicing of the small
            victories and working together.” </p>
        <p>Lee nodded. </p>
        <p> “Could I stay here a while? Learn what you all did, and then go home?” He asked, “my planet...is still a
            waste land.” </p>
        <p> “Of course,” Lola nodded, “as long as they leave us in peace.” Her old hand covered his. It was tough as
            leather and covered in sunspots, but it was warm and she squeezed his hand gently. </p>
        <p>It was several years before Lee left the planet to return home. He had grown taller, the skin of his hands turned tough as leather and a spattering if freckles from spending everyday in the sun, planting and harvesting. The day finally came and he threw a sack of seeds and provisions over his shoulder, heading to where his ship had sat for half a decade. Bernard, leaning on a cane was waiting for him at the hatch.</p>

        <p>“Ready to head home kid?” The koala asked.</p>

        <p>“Take me home,” Lee answered, “We have a long journey ahead of us.”</p>

        <p>Lee was about to close the hatch when he saw movement in the long golden grass.</p>

        <p>“Hey!” Loti yelled and dove onto the ship. Benard hopped to his feet and waddled over.</p>

        <p>“There ain’t enough fucking room for you!” Koala exclaimed.</p>

        <p>“That doesn’t matter,” Loti exclaimed and stood up tall. “Now that grandmother is gone, I wanna see the universe. Please, let me come with you?”</p>

        <p>The human and the Koala looked at eachother, then the fiery woman.</p>

        <p>“I guess we have enough provisions,” Lee said and Loti threw her arms around him, ruffling his hair. “Thanks, you dopes.”</p>

        <p>All three of themselves made themselves comfortable in the small ship and set off, going back home to rebuild.</p>
