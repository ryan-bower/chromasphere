            Orange Melody Planet
        </h1>
        <p>
            Space Shuttle landed near the town. Few tribesmen came to welcome him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Orange Melody Planet was quite unique and their environment was very beautiful. All the colors of the plants
            and the forests were in a range of orange family variations. The leaves were very bright orange. Most of
            plants were dark orange or yellow-orange. It was orange everywhere. Lee stared with wide eyes, he couldn’t
            stop being amazed at everything everywhere.

        </p>
        <p>
            Lee didn’t bother to listen, he couldn’t stop exploring around the forest.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bernard scoffed, “Whatever, just don’t listen to me. Oooo so amazing. It is just a color. If you asked me, I
            found it rather boring. Too much orange. It is like I am looking at orangutan everyday.”

        </p>
        <p>
            Lee turned around and shouted, “It is nothing anything like my home. The texture is so amazing. Yet, you
            said they are boring. Have you lost some marbles while you are in space?”

        </p>
        <p>
            Bernard chuckled, “Why do I even bother to argue with 11 years old dumb boy? Of course, you would go nuts
            over this shitty forest.”

        </p>
        <p>
            Lee frowned. Bernard didn’t bother to look at him, “Ahh we should be almost at the capitol building.”

        </p>
        <p>
            Lee started to look around and saw the tribe were made up of orange skin people and talking animals. He
            could see a giraffe talked to zerba. He dropped his jaw. Bernard looked at him, “What is matter? Boy! Shut
            your pithole! You look like a dumb monkey who wouldn’t stop screaming.”

        </p>
        <p>
            Suddenly, bunch of animals ran toward Bernard as if they were waiting for his return. They picked him up and
            threw him into air for few times.

        </p>
        <p>
            Bernard snapped, “Knock it off! I had enough of that! Put me down! You bunch of birdbrains!” The talking
            animals just grabbed him and walked away. “Go ahead without me! I will come back!”

        </p>
        <p>
            Lee couldn’t help but giggled for the whole time. Finally, the chief came out of the capitol building, met
            them up and welcomed them to their town with a big bright smile.

        </p>
        <p>
            “We are always excited to see a new face. Any friend of Bernard is a friend of ours. I hope you enjoy what
            you are seeing so far. So, feel free to stay as long as you want and enjoy your stay.” He called his friend
            over, “This is Ekkaz. He will be your guide for the week. He knows everything about our home, people, and
            planet very well. Feel free to ask him about anything,” The chief greeted.

        </p>
        <p>
            Ekkaz was a tall and slender with natural orange skin. He dressed up casual quite nicely. Ekkaz spoke, “So,
            before we start moving forward with a tour, we better find you a place to stay first.”

        </p>
        <p>
            Lee nodded.

        </p>
        <p>
            As the week has passed, they learned that those people were very pleasant with almost everyone and
            everything they met and heard. The boy told a brief story about his upbringing with his brother. The tribe
            just sat still, nodding slowly with a big smile on their faces. He was not even sure if they really listened
            to him or they were being polite.

        </p>
        <p>
            A woman suddenly stood up and spoke, “Your brother was super peculiar. He wouldn’t stop introducing his
            ideas to us. He kept saying he wants to help us out with our poverty and education. Even though, we said no
            over and over. Did he think we are ignorant or something?”

        </p>
        <p>
            Lee stammered, “I don’t know why. I haven’t seen my brother for a long while.”


        </p>
        <p>
            The other person stood up, “Please do not get us wrong, we do not really hate him. He is a kind guy, but he
            went too far at the point that we almost kicked him out of our village. We are satisfied with what we have
            been living our lives.”


        </p>
        <p>
            The rest of tribesmen cheerfully agreed with their comments.

        </p>
        <p>
            Lee realized that he or his brother had no rights to encourage and change their way of life if they were
            happy with their current status and culture.Those tribesmen didn’t have any luxury houses, or anything. They
            didn’t exactly have a strong education system. Most of them are home schooled. Red tribesmen had a way
            better life than orange tribesmen. They used trade items as their economy. It was very primitive style. Yet,
            they were very satisfied regardless. It was almost like they accepted and appreciated what they had right
            now. He was totally speechless. He finally understood why his brother struggled to understand how they
            accept their culture as if it is normal to them.

        </p>
        <p>
            Ekkaz stood up and pulled the boy out of bar. Lee was confused.


        </p>
        <p>
            Ekkaz said, “I didn’t know that your older brother is Kai. I didn’t exactly like him, but he is still a good
            guy. You should have asked me earlier about him…. Because…. I know where your brother is.”

        </p>
        <p>
            Lee was surprised and anxious asking Ekkaz, “What? Where is he? Is he still alive?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Ekkaz sighed, “I think I better show you.”

        </p>
        <p>
            Ekkaz guided him to the back of the town. He walked in silence Lee trailing behind. He wouldn’t dare to ask
            him about anything. Finally, they arrived at the park full of giant orange trees. Ekkaz pointed out at a
            tombstone and told Lee, “Go over there and take a look.”

        </p>
        <p>
            Lee was walking toward it and took a closer look at the tombstone. He whispered, “Kai.” He fell down on his
            knees. “So, he is really gone,” Lee mumbled. When he looked down, he saw the letter lying on the ground. He
            picked up the letter and opened it.

        </p>
        <p>
            He read:

        </p>
        <p>
            “If you ever find this letter lil’ bro, (which I believe you will), First of all, I want to say I am sorry
            that I won’t be able to come back home. My time is almost up. The poison from those mist in purple planet is
            incurable. I could barely breathe now. Guess this planet will be my final. I have too many regrets. I tried
            to help many and none of them were successful. I was furious. I mean why can’t anyone understand that I am
            trying to help. Until I came to this planet, it made me open my eyes. I realized that I was wrong. Those
            people were amazing. They just accepted at everything they see. That was the problem within me. I refused to
            accept at anything that I see. I refused to accept Red tribesmen desire for war. I refused to accept
            anything I see in other planets lived their life. That is why I struggled and struggled. I just don’t see
            their reasons. Well, I hope you learn something from those people. I spent my final moments with them. I am
            ready to go and this place will be my grave. My only wish is able to be there and watch my lil bro grow into
            a great man. Good bye.”

        </p>
        <p>
            Lee burst into tears. Ekkaz knelt next to him and patted him on the shoulder. He walked him back to inn
            where the boy stayed.

            “Are you absolutely sure?” Bernard asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            “There is nothing left for me back home. There is nobody who would expect my return. I love it here. It
            is an adventure everyday. I believe my brother wants me to grow up here into a great man and that is
            what I am going to do.” said the Lee with a slight smile.

        </p>
        <p>
            Bernard paused for the moment, “Alright, it was a crazy journey. Glad I had a nice time with you. Take
            care of yourself. I will definitely come back and visit you sometime.”

        </p>
        <p>
            Lee replied, “You do that. You are my only real friend.”


        </p>
        <p>
            Bernard chuckled and closed the door.

        </p>
        <p>
            The spaceship launched into space. The boy just stood there, watching it go...

        <p>
            “Yeah,” Lee answered back. “I explored every planet that Kai went before. There is nothing left for me
            to do. It is time for me to go back home where I belonged to. That is what my brother would want me to.”

        </p>
        <p>
            “Alright, whatever you decided, boy,” Bernard put their backpacks into the rocket and started the
            engine.

        </p>
        <p>
            Lee stared through the window. He whispered at himself, “It was a fun adventure.” The spaceship
            ultimately launched off.
        </p>
        <p>
            The boy went back home…

        </p>
        <p>
            Once, they entered the space, the message popped up in the computer. Bernard and Lee was startled. Lee
            took a closer look. Bernard whispered, “Look like it said you can accept the message or decline it and
            it will be delete forever.”


        </p>
        <p>
            Lee hesitated.

        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="lexia-link lexia-back" onclick="clickLexia ('lexia-a')">Decline it</span>

        <p><span class="lexia-link lexia-back" onclick="clickLexia ('lexia-b')">Accept it</span></p>

    <div id="lexia-a">
        <h1>

        </h1>
        <p>
            The message was deleted forever. Bernard and Lee went <span class="lexia-link"
                                                                        onclick="clickLexia ('lexia-start')">back to the start</span>.

        </h1>
        <p>
            The message revealed the final letter from Kai. Bernard was completely confusing, “What? Since when did he
            put the message in my computer? How???? My password should be unbreakable. Wait? Don’t tell me…. That
            bastard, I am gotta shove my computer up in his dead ass…”

        </p>
        <p>
            “Shut up!” Lee interrupted and started reading the message;

        </p>
        <p>
            Well, I guess you decided to continue your journey. That is good. I know you would want to finish what I
            started. Alright, here is the coordination to the Gold planet. It is pretty far from Orange Melody planet.
            Fun fact, I never go to Gold Planet before. So, make me a proud brother.
        </p>
        <p>
            “WHAT? GOLD PLANET. I never hear anything like that. How in the world did this bastard learn about Gold
            planet.” Bernard blasted.


        </p>
        <p>
            Lee replied in calm voice, “Who cares? This is an opportunity to explore. We could be first travelers to
            discover a new planet. I am going whatever you like it or not.”

        </p>
        <p>
            Bernard mumbled, “Fine! What are we waiting for?”
